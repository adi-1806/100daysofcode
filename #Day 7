# 11. Container With Most Water

# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

# Notice that you may not slant the container.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        maxwater, i, j = 0, 0, len(height) - 1  
        while i < j: 
            maxwater = max(maxwater, (j - i) * min(height[i], height[j])) 
            if height[i] < height[j]:  
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return maxwater
