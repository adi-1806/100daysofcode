# 739. Daily Temperatures

# Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(temperatures)
        answer = [0] * n
        stack = []

        for i in range(n):
            while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] < temperatures[i]:
                idx = stack.pop()
                answer[idx] = i - idx 
            stack.append(i) 

        return answer
